##Key Questions Guiding Analysis
  - How does discovery translate into deeper reader engagement?
  - Which save motivations are key in converting interest to high reading intent?
  - How can book saving behaviour be used to optimize marketing strategies by publishers. 

##Key Insights Derived
  - Plot-driven Booktok content results in the strongest combination of scale and conversion to reader intent suggesting it to be the highest return on investment for publishers aiming to utilize TikTok to further novel reach. 
  - Vibe/Aesthetic and Quote-based content is key for awareness of promotion material but plot explanations lead to higher levels of reader intent offering more novel insight. As such, it's useful to leverage both in new releases.
  - Promotional strategies should be customized by genre rather than a uniform marketing strategy. Hook style for example needs to be catered to genre-specific reader behaviour such as the strong link between emotional hooks and the romance genre.
  - Creator trust converts well into reader intent, but is underutilized on Booktok and as such should be scaled to optimize reach and sales. 

## These are key considerations for content creation, creator partnership decisions as well as campaign strategy during promotional periods. Leveraging insights from readers' interest and intent can greatly guide decision-making in these fields.
